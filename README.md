# 📚 Library Management System 

A simple console-based Library Management System built in Java. This project allows users to add, remove, and view books dynamically, using core object-oriented programming concepts.

## ✅ Features

- Add books to a dynamic array-based library
- View a list of current books
- Remove a book by title
- Track the **total number of books ever added** using a static variable
- Interactive console-based UI using Java's `Scanner`
- Automatically resizes the internal array when capacity is exceeded

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java (Standard Edition)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Arrays and basic data structures
- Console I/O

## 🧪 How It Works

- The `Library` class manages an array of books and handles dynamic resizing.
- The `TestLibrary` class provides a console interface for user interaction.
- Users can choose from a menu to perform operations such as adding or removing books.
- Internally, a static counter tracks how many books have been added throughout the program’s life.

## 🏃 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Java installed.
2. Save the code in a file named `TestLibrary.java`.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the file’s directory.
4. Compile the program:

   ```bash
   javac TestLibrary.java

## 📂 File Structure

.
└── TestLibrary.java   # Contains both Library class and main method

## 📌 Example Menu

Choose an operation:
1. Add a book
2. View books
3. Remove a book
4. View total books added
5. Exit
